A 2D imaging project to study the effectiveness of radio signal attenuation measurements (used 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi signals) to survey walled areas, like a room, with large dimensions (>5m).

arduino_r1.ino and wemos_r1.ino - Code written for Atmega8 based Arduino Uno and ESP8266 based Wemos D1 board respectively. The code controls the working of motor, WiFi signal.

imageProcessCode.m - Matlab image processing code for image generation.
